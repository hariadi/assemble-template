**Why use Grunt?**
The Grunt ecosystem is huge and it's growing every day. With literally
hundreds of plugins to choose from, you can use Grunt to automate just
about anything with a minimum of effort. If someone hasn't already
built what you need, authoring and publishing your own Grunt plugin to
npm is a breeze.


## Table of Contents
An experimental TOC helper that finds headers in the given path, parses
them and turns them into links.

{{{toc './src/content/chapter-*.md.hbs'}}}

---

## Partial
This is a _Handlebars partial_. Notice we have to add the `.md` extension here because you don't normally need an extension in a partial, but we're referencing a file with the extension `.md.hbs`, so we need to tell the engine that this is correct. 

{{> chapter-01-getting-started.md }}

## `\{{md}}` helper
This is a _markdown helper_. 

{{{md './src/content/code.md'}}}

---

## `\{{include}}` helper
A third way to "include" content, using the _include_ helper.

{{{include './src/content/chapter-01-getting-started.md.hbs'}}}
